#tuples:
#A built-in data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values
#like strings

tup = (2,1,3,4)
print(type(tup))
print(tup[0])
print(tup[1])
#we can also create empty tupe -> "()"

#tup = (1) -> python will assume it as normal variable not as tuple
#so single element tuple should contain comma after that element

#tuple slicing is also present just like list and str

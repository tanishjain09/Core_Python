#The Walrus Operator is a new addition to Python 3.8 and allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression.
# This can be useful when you need to use a value multiple times in a loop, but don't want to repeat the calculation.
# The Walrus Operator is represented by the := syntax and can be used in a variety of contexts including while loops and if statements.

# a = True
print(a := False)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

while (n := len(numbers)) > 0:
    print(numbers.pop())

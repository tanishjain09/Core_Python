**** A virtual environment is a tool used to isolate specific Python environments on a single machine, allowing you
to work on multiple projects with different dependencies and packages without conflicts. This can be especially
useful when working on projects that have conflicting package versions or packages that are not compatible with each other. ****

To create a virtual environment in Python, you can use the venv module that comes with Python.
Here's an example of how to create a virtual environment and activate it:

'''
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv environment_Name

# Activate the virtual environment
source environment_Name/bin/activate

'''

To deactivate the virtual environment, you can use the deactivate command:

deactivate

This repository is a collection of my Core Python learning journey. As I learn and practice Python programming, I'm documenting my progress here. It includes chapter-wise topics, practice questions, and small projects to help me solidify my understanding of Python fundamentals.

What's Inside?
Chapter-wise Topics: Each folder represents a chapter covering essential Python concepts, from basics to advanced topics.

Practice Questions: Hands-on exercises to test my understanding of each topic.

Mini-Projects: Small, practical projects to apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios.

Code Examples: Clean and well-commented code snippets for each concept.


Topics Covered
Python Basics: Syntax, data types, variables, and input/output.

Control Flow: Conditional statements (if, elif, else), loops (for, while).

Functions: Defining functions, arguments, return values, and lambda functions.

Data Structures: Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and their operations.

File Handling: Reading from and writing to files.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Error Handling: Try-except blocks, custom exceptions.

Modules and Packages: Importing modules, creating custom packages.

Advanced Topics: Decorators, generators, and iterators.

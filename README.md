This repository is a collection of my Core Python learning journey. As I learn and practice Python programming, I'm documenting my progress here. It includes chapter-wise topics, practice questions, and small projects to help me solidify my understanding of Python fundamentals.

What's Inside?
1.Chapter-wise Topics: Each folder represents a chapter covering essential Python concepts, from basics to advanced topics.

2.Practice Questions: Hands-on exercises to test my understanding of each topic.

3.Mini-Projects: Small, practical projects to apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios.
